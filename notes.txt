                                Setup
- we install sdk (software development kit) zip folder for installing flutter, extract the flutter folder from it into c: disk but avoid putting in program files, windows or downloads folder that may cause permission error.
- edit system environment variables to add the path of bin folder in the flutter.
- 'flutter --version'
- install 'android studio' & 'vysor' 
- add the extensions(plugins) dart & flutter in VScode and android studio.
- install a device emulator from AVD(android virtual devices) manager in android studio after custom SDK manager settings(platforms & tools) to match the installed emulators.
- run the command 'flutter doctor'
- 'flutter create app-name' to create full flutter app automatically.
- the extension 'error lens' in VScode used to show the error while writing code before run debugging.
- "dart run file-name.dart"

                                OOP
- because dart doesn't support function overloading, in oop there's a concept of named constructors. and optional-positional or optional-named parameters.
- Multiple inheritance (a class inheriting from multiple superclasses) is not allowed in Dart.
  Instead, Dart provides mixins, where a class can extend only one class but can use multiple mixins using the with keyword.
- the polymorphism is a greek word means 'many forms' acts the sub-class as an instance fron the parent(super-class) but with different behavior. 
  achieved by function overloading or overriding, but as dart doesn't support overloading, it's just method overriding.
- Method overriding is when a subclass provides a new implementation for a method that already exists in its superclass using the annotation @override to modify or extend the behavior of the inherited method.
- enum is used to define a fixed set of named constants, which helps avoid errors from using raw (literal) values such as strings or numbers.
