                                Setup
- we install sdk (software development kit) zip folder for installing flutter, extract the flutter folder from it into c: disk but avoid putting in program files, windows or downloads folder that may cause permission error.
- edit system environment variables to add the path of bin folder in the flutter.
- 'flutter --version'
- install 'android studio' & 'vysor' 
- add the extensions(plugins) dart & flutter in VScode and android studio.
- install a device emulator from AVD(android virtual devices) manager in android studio after custom SDK manager settings(platforms & tools) to match the installed emulators.
- run the command 'flutter doctor'
- 'flutter create app-name' to create full flutter app automatically.
- the extension 'error lens' in VScode used to show the error while writing code before run debugging.
* run dart file: 
  - "dart run file-name.dart" or directly 'dart file-name.dart'-> run in TERMINAL.
  - clicking the Run option appears in grey at the top of main function-> run in DEBUG CONSOLE.
  - clicking the run icon in top right corner-> show the OUTPUT.

                                OOP
- because dart doesn't support function overloading, in oop there's a concept of named constructors. and optional-positional or optional-named parameters.
- Multiple inheritance (a class inheriting from multiple superclasses) is not allowed in Dart.
  Instead, Dart provides mixins, where a class can extend only one class but can use multiple mixins using the with keyword.
- the polymorphism is a greek word means 'many forms' acts the sub-class as an instance fron the parent(super-class) but with different behavior. 
  achieved by function overloading or overriding, but as dart doesn't support overloading, it's just method overriding.
- Method overriding is when a subclass provides a new implementation for a method that already exists in its superclass using the annotation @override to modify or extend the behavior of the inherited method.
- enum (enumerator) class is used to define a fixed set of named constants, which helps avoid errors from using raw (literal) values such as strings or numbers.

                        asynchronous programming
- Synchronous programming executes tasks one after another, while asynchronous programming allows tasks to start without waiting for others to finish, so the program doesn’t block during long operations
- Using await makes asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code inside the function, but it still runs asynchronously without blocking the whole program.

                            flutter app
- creating new flutter project in android studio: in flutter sdk put the installed 'flutter' directory path 'C:/flutter'... edit platforms to (web, android)only at beginning.
- in system environment variables the path of flutter must be above the dart-sdk in order for android-studio project to run , as the flutter directory include its own dart version differ from the standalone one so make flutter at the front of variables list prevent this conflict.
- from settings-> search for android SDK then android SDK command-line tools to install and click ok.
- run 'flutter doctor --android-licenses' to accept android licenses.
- the most used files: pubspec.yaml like in dart app store the project name, desciption, assets, dependencies and dev-dependencies.  /  lib folder that contains the main and child widgets dart files
- 'flutter run -d web-server' give localhost url to run in chrome emulator.
- the flutter widget constructor receive named parameters where the name written in camelcase and the value is static, enum properties or another child widget.
- the shortcut stless+enter create a widget class that extends StatelessWidget from the package 'package:flutter/material.dart'.
- 'alt-enter'-> wrap with widget-> write the widget
- accessing color values: Colors.specificColor or Color('e.g value in hexaDecimal') then .shade[num] to control its degree of darkness
- flutter enable import outside files without export it clearly.
